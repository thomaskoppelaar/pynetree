# Hey, I'm Thomas.
I occasionally will place content here that I've created, or talk about things that interest me. 
Currently, this site is **volatile**: It's very likely to go down, go offline, change themes, layouts, etc.

I'd ask you to stay tuned for new content, but I'll most likely tell you to check it out anyway.
